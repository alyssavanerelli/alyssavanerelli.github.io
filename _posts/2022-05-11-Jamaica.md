For three weeks this summer, I was fortunate to be able to assist graduate student [Inbar Maayan](http://www.inbarmaayan.com/) in the field studying Jamaican anoles! I'm extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to study anoles in the field for the first time 
in a place as beautiful as Jamaica. One of the most rewarding parts of this trip was getting to see my study species, _Anolis grahami_, in their natural habitat - they are truly magnificent lizards! Being naturalists, we used this opportunity to look for other 
animal species as well, like the [Jamaican Tody](https://ebird.org/species/jamtod1) and the [magnificent frigatebird](https://ebird.org/species/magfri)! Jamaica is such a lovely island and I can't wait to go back!

## Meet the Jamaican Anoles!

Jamaican anoles form a monophyletic group of 7 anoles: _Anolis grahami_, _Anolis garmani_, _Anolis conspersus_, _Anolis opalinus_, _Anolis lineatopus_, _Anolis reconditus_, and _Anolis valencienni_. All of these species are endemic to Jamaica except for _Anolis 
conspersus_, which is endemic to Grand Cayman and not found in Jamaica. There is also an introduced population of _Anolis sagrei_ on the island.

#### **_Anolis grahami_**

This anole is native to Jamamica and has more recently been introduced to Bermuda. They are a trunk-crown ecomorph, meaning that they are found from around eye-level on the tree up to the canopy and have a long snout, slender body, and shorter legs with 
well-developed toepads. We currently have two recognized subspecies: _Anolis grahami grahami_ and _Anolis grahami aquarum_. _A. g. grahami_ is a beautiful rainbow color and is found throughout most of Jamaica, while _A. g. aquarum_ is restricted to certain areas on 
the Eastern side of the island and is a striking lime green color.

_A. grahami_ is one of the few species of anoles that vocalize! There are actually a few Jamaican anole species that vocalize including _A. garmani_, _A. opalinus_, and _A. valencienni_. To read about other vocalizing anoles, check out this [blog 
post](https://www.anoleannals.org/2013/10/28/on-vocalizing-anoles/). 

My recent work has been focused on assembling a chromosome-scale reference genome for this species, which enables us to answer a suite of questions about _A. grahami_ and the Jamaican anole clade. To read more about this project, [click

#### **_Anolis garmani_**

This crown-giant anole is the largest species of Jamaican lizard. They are usually found high in trees on trunks or branches and have a large head. This species, often called Sawback, has a spiky crest running down the back, although females and juvenilles sometimes 
don't possess this feature. They also have these characteristic stripes on the sides of the body.
