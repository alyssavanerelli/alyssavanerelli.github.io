My name is Alyssa Vanerelli and I am a PhD student in the Center for Computational and Integrative Biology program at Rutgers University Camden, working with [Dr. Anthony 
Geneva](https://genevalab.io/). I received my B.S. in Biology at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, where I studied the ecology and evolution of Caribbean boas with [Dr. Graham 
Reynolds](https://reynoldslab.wp.unca.edu/). In my free time, I enjoy birding, crafting, and taking photos!
