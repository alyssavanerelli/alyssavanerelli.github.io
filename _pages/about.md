My name is Alyssa Vanerelli and I am a PhD candidate in the [Geneva Lab](https://genevalab.io/) at [Rutgers University](https://ccib.camden.rutgers.edu/), where I am studying the evolutionary 
genomics of _Anolis_ lizards. I received my B.S. in Biology at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, where I studied the ecology and evolution of Caribbean boas with 
[Dr. Graham Reynolds](https://reynoldslab.wp.unca.edu/). In my free time, I enjoy birding, crafting, and taking photos! Connect with me on 
[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/avanerelli) and [eBird](https://ebird.org/profile/MTg2MzcyOA)!

I am interested in using genomics to understand the evolutionary history of _Anolis_ lizards. My research focuses on answering questions related to adaptation, genome 
evolution, convergence, and phylogenetics. Check out the [projects page](https://alyssavanerelli.github.io/projects/) to read about my current and past research projects!
