### Evolution Meeting
_July 2024_

I was very excited to share my research at the [Evolution meeting](https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/) in Montreal, Canada this
year! I presented about testing alternative phylogenetic hypotheses in squamate reptiles 
and investigating sex chromosome evolution using the _Anolis grahami_ genome assembly. 
Watch my talk [here](https://youtu.be/BmbtUwcLU4c?si=gGvHcNz0A7K1tIWn&t=798)!

### JMIH Presentation
_July 2023_
   
I had the wonderful opportunity to travel to JMIH 2023 on the 
[SSAR Student Travel Award](https://ssarherps.org/ssar-awards/student-travel-award/) to 
present my research studying the [evolution of large body size in _Anolis sagrei_](https://alyssavanerelli.github.io/projects/2_project/)

### JMIH Presentation
_July 2022_

I had such a great time sharing my research on assembling a reference genome for _Anolis grahami_ at [JMIH](https://burkclients.com/JMIH/meetings/2022/site/) this year! This was my first JMIH and it was such a wonderful opportunity to make new friends and hear about 
really exciting herpetology research.

### Spruce-Fir Conservation PechaKucha
_May 2021_

This is my [PechaKucha](https://pechakuchaavl.org/what-is-pecha-kucha) presentation for my public speaking final competition. A PechaKucha is a special type of presentation where the presenter has 
20 slides that automatically advance after 20 seconds. For my speech, I chose to talk about Southern Appalachian Spruce-Fir forest conservation and I tied for first place! This was such a fun 
opportunity to try out this presentation style and share information about this wonderful mountain range that I call home!
