### JMIH Presentation
_July 2022_

I had such a great time sharing my research on assembling a reference genome for _Anolis grahami_ at [JMIH](https://burkclients.com/JMIH/meetings/2022/site/) this year! This was my first JMIH and it was such a wonderful opportunity to make new friends and hear about 
really exciting herpetology research.

### Spruce-Fir Conservation PechaKucha
_May 2021_

This is my [PechaKucha](https://pechakuchaavl.org/what-is-pecha-kucha) presentation for my public speaking final competition. A PechaKucha is a special type of presentation where the presenter has 
20 slides that automatically advance after 20 seconds. For my speech, I chose to talk about Southern Appalachian Spruce-Fir forest conservation and I tied for first place! This was such a fun 
opportunity to try out this presentation style and share information about this wonderful mountain range that I call home!
