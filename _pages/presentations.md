### Spruce-Fir Conservation PechaKucha
_May 2021_

This is my [PechaKucha](https://pechakuchaavl.org/what-is-pecha-kucha) presentation for my public speaking final competition. A PechaKucha is a special type of presentation where the presenter has 
20 slides that automatically advance after 20 seconds. For my speech, I chose to talk about Southern Appalachian Spruce-Fir forest conservation and I tied for first place! This was such a fun 
opportunity to try out this presentation style and share information about this wonderful mountain range that I call home!
