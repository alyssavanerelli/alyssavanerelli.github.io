Highly complete and contiguous genome assemblies are necessary to answer many evolutionary questions. While _Anolis_ lizards have been the focus of decades of ecological and evolutionary research, 
only a few of the 400+ species have high-quality genome assemblies available. One of the many anoles lacking a genome assembly is _Anolis grahami_, a widespread species native to Jamaica and 
introduced to Bermuda. This trunk-crown anole has long been the focus of ecological and evolutionary research. To provide modern genomic resources for the study of this species, we sequenced, 
assembled, and annotated a high-quality reference genome. We present a highly contiguous (N50 = 137 Mb) and complete (only 11.4% vertebrate BUSCO genes missing) genome. Using this genome, we infer 
the phylogenomic relationships among squamates, report chromosome evolution of _A. grahami_, and evaluate chromosome synteny of _A. grahami_ with other anole species.
