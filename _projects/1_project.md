Highly complete and contiguous genome assemblies are necessary to answer many evolutionary questions. While _Anolis_ lizards have been the focus of decades of ecological and evolutionary research, 
only a few of the 400+ species have high-quality genome assemblies available. 


One of the many anoles lacking a genome assembly is _Anolis grahami_, a widespread species native to Jamaica and introduced to Bermuda. There are currently two recognized subspecies, _Anolis grahami 
grahami_ and _Anolis grahami aquarum_ (see photos below). _A. g. grahami_ is a beautiful rainbow color and found throughout most of the island, while _A. g. aquarum_ is restricted to certain areas 
east of the Blue Mountains and is a striking lime green color. _A. grahami_ is also one of the few anole species that vocalize. To learn more about _A. grahami_ and other Jamaican anoles, check out 
my [blog post](https://alyssavanerelli.github.io/blog/2022/Jamaica/). This trunk-crown anole has long been the focus of ecological and evolutionary research. Previous research has shown that 
haplotypes from geographic populations of _A. grahami_ are highly divergent suggesting that this species may be a complex of species (Jackman et al. 2002)[^1]. Blake (1986)[^2] also showed that 
there are multiple fission events in this species, as well as extensive chromosomal variation that did not coincide with subspecies borders. With this highly complete and contiguous reference 
genome, we can begin to dive into some of these interesting observations.

To provide modern genomic resources for the study of this species, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated a high-quality reference genome. We present a highly contiguous (N50 = 137 Mb) and complete 
(only 11.4% vertebrate BUSCO genes missing) genome. Using this genome, we infer the phylogenomic relationships among squamates, report sex chromosome evolution of _A. grahami_, and evaluate 
chromosome synteny of _A. grahami_ with other anole species.
