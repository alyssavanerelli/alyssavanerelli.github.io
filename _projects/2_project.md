Anoles are well-known for their ability to convergently evolve to similar environments, e.g. anoles in the Greater Antilles have adapted to similar micro-habitats and have been placed into "ecomorph" classes discribing their behavior, habitat use, and morphology. 
_Anolis sagrei_ is a trunk-ground anole, which means it is a medium-sized stocky species with long hindlimbs and poorly-developed toepads. They are usually found around 1-1.5 meters above the ground on the tree trunk[^1]. Although on some islands, anoles in the _A. 
sagrei_ clade don't occupy this niche space and have evolved a different phenotype. _Anolis nelsoni_ from the Swan islands and _Anolis luteosignifer_ from Cayman Brac are both within the _A. sagrei_ clade, occur on islands without competitors, and have evolved 
significant differences in morphology.

Both of these species arrived to their respective islands from Cuba, and have independently evolved a significantly larger body size than other _A. sagrei_ species. There is also more differentiation between the sexes on these islands (see photo below). Anthony 
Geneva  used morphological data from _A. luteosignifer_, _A. nelsoni_, _A. s. mayensis_, _A. s. ordinatus_, and _A. s. sagrei_ to make a principle component analysis (Figure 1).
