Anoles are well-known for their ability to convergently evolve to similar environments, e.g. anoles in the Greater Antilles have adapted to similar micro-habitats and have been placed into "ecomorph" classes describing their behavior, habitat use, and morphology.
Insular anole species are known to have far fewer competitors than their mainland counterparts, and display higher population densities and broader niches because of ecological release[^2]. 
_Anolis sagrei_ is a trunk-ground anole, which means it is a medium-sized stocky species with long hindlimbs and poorly-developed toepads. They are usually found around 1-1.5 meters above the ground on the tree trunk[^1]. 
While most species within this clade conform to this phenotype, some have evolved significant differences in morphology and habitat use.
_Anolis s. nelsoni_ from the Swan islands and _Anolis s. luteosignifer_ from Cayman Brac both occur on islands without competitors and have evolved these phenotypic differences due to ecological release. 
Lister (1976) showed that both _A. s. nelsoni_ and _A. s. luteosignifer_ displayed a significant increase in mean perch height and perch height diversity, suggesting that these subspecies utilize perch heights that are commonly used by other competing _Anolis_ 
species on species-rich islands.
Not only do these subspecies expand their structural niche in the absence of competing _Anolis_ species, they also show a greater range fo thermal niche usage. Since these lizards are able to occupy niche spaces usually unavailable to them, they exhibit greater 
variance in temperature than _A. sagrei_ species on islands with other anole species.
In addition, _A. s. nelsoni_ and _A. s. luteosignifer_ have shown an increase in food niche space, with these subspecies consuming a larger variety of prey sizes[^2].
Lister also showed that an increase in mean perch height by these solitary anoles was strongly correlated with an increase in mean toe lamellae number. Lamellae are adaptively important for anoles as they allow the lizards to adhere to branches and leaves better. 
This increase in lamellae number presumably allows these _A. sagrei_ subspecies to expand their niche space upwards into the tree.
In a comparison between solitary anole species and those occurring with competitors, it was shown that solitary anoles have convergently evolved to have an optimal intermediate head length. They show significantly less variation in head length than the anoles 
occurring in areas with other species[^3].

There is also more differentiation between the sexes on these islands (see photo below). 
Anthony Geneva used morphological data from _A. luteosignifer_, _A. nelsoni_, _A. s. mayensis_, _A. s. ordinatus_, and _A. s. sagrei_ to make a principle component analysis (Figure 1).
